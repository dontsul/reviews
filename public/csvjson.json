I was strolling in city walk Dubai & saw PIAZZA 17, Thought of trying the Pizza's, chicken Nuggets & Coffee from there. That day was valentine's day - They have made heart shape pizza for me & my loved ones - Was really good & attractive. Do visit & try the Pasta, Pizza, Truffles & Coffee.",

Also, enjoy the Burj view while you eat. I ordered👇🏻\nMargarita Pizza: Believe me, the best margarita I had in Dubai. Right amount of tomato sauce, basil, cheese & base cooked to perfection. A must try 👅\n🥤Blue Lagoon Mojito: This was such a refreshing drink & exactly how I like it. So so good.\nHot Chocolate: Creamy, rich & yummy hot chocolate topped with whipped cream. Wish it’s bit sweet.\nEverything is priced reasonably and the staff are polite & sweet. Also Free parking available right behind their food truck.",

But once the weather in Dubai gets better, this is the place to be! 😍\nSuper cute display for our iced tea. The Diavola pizza was amazing. (Quite spicy) I love spicy but for the ones who don’t, be aware.\nLet’s not talk about the mozzarella truffle bites. WOW 😍 I looooved it!! Tried the coconut gelato as well and we all were speechless.\nWe went quite late, around 11pm we were there. It was such a nice vibe and the music. First we heard nice early 2000s songs, then some nice afro jam and then the bachata playlist came on. 😄 other people started to come around midnight and I started to teach my friend some bachata moves.\nIt was just an amazing overall experience. Will definitely come back once the weather cools down!",

You can easily find it between old and new City Walk parts, the parking just behind it is free of charge, which is very convenient.\nFor the food, I’ve had Fungi aka Mushroom Pizza and a coffee latte with Mini Krapfen = custard crème mini doughnuts. Pizza was nice with thin Italian dough and generous topping of cheese, mushrooms and tomato sauce. And the latte with Crapfens stole my heart❤️ Coffee was served on a holder with a blue rose and on top of the milk foam was the logo of the Piazza 17. Mini doughnuts were fresh and soft, full of delicious crème. So good!\nAlso I would like to thank the stuff for the perfect service and fun music!",

You can order take away or sit there to eat, be mindfull you will be sitting outside so I would recomend going around sunset. The staff there was very nice with me and the food was really good. I highly reccomend you try their gellato, I had the avocado one and it was amazing.",

The service was great and I loved the blue mojito!! Honestly my fav of the things I had was the pancakes tho. So def check those out.\nHonestly though, the gelato they gave was literally just lemon ice. I genuinely hope they do something about that because gelato is supposed to be soft. It is quite a bit over priced too! Check out my instagram @vuja_de_official for an honest review from Papa foodie!",

Hotdogs that seem to be from the frozen supermarket brand, fries that are flavorless both smothered in ketchup and mustard. The Italian hotdog ventured into a more exotic pesto flavor that also failed the basic taste test....\nFive hotdogs, semi cooked arrived after a 45 minute wait....\nOverall, will take a miss for this place next time...",

The staffs are very accomodating and the place got a nice view where you can see burj khalifa. It is around city walk so you can also walk around to places but this restaurant is a must-visit list in dubai. The vibe is awesome. Go check it out by yourself. It is 10/10",
